# Odin Project Rock-Paper-Scissors

## A basic rock-paper-scissors game vs randomly generated computer choices
The purpose of this project was to test my basic javascript skills.

## How to play
Clicking any of the options given to the player starts a round vs the randomly selected computer choice. The current score can be seen aswell as the results for a completed set which goes on until either the player or the computer scores 5 points.
